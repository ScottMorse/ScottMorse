## About Me

Hi, I'm Scott!

I do use AI to help me work, but I don't use it to talk to you, so none of what is written here was generated.

### Experience and Stack

I have broad experience as a React developer, backend developer, cloud architect, owner of enterprise DevOps, and so on. TypeScript is my main language, and [Bun](https://bun.sh) is my runtime of choice for it, though I'm flexible with using whatever tools I need.

### My Current Work

Check out [`bun-workspaces`](https://bunworkspaces.com), a CLI and API for managing JS/TS monorepos.

I created `bun-workspaces` originally simply because I wanted it to exist for myself, a monorepo tool that works on top of native tooling.
